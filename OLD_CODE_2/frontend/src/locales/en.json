        "1": {
          "question": "What's the main advantage of the service?",
          "answer": "Regular VPN providers are untrustworthy when it comes to protecting your data. They collect data about you and sell it or give it up at the first demand from a government, similar to Internet Service Providers. You must choose which one is more likely to be trustworthy and has fewer chances of data leakage. Because you utilize your own server, there are no such issues with our service."

        "2": {
          "question": "Can I use one installed VPN server for several devices and users?",
          "answer": "Yes, if each device is using a distinct configuration file. We supply five configuration files by default for each server."
        },
        "3": {
          "question": "Can I use the same configurational file on several devices?",
          "answer": "That's not recommended. Because if two devices have an active internet connection at the same time, they would be interfering with each other."
        },
        "4": {
          "question": "How much is it going to cost me to use ShapeVPN?",
          "answer": "Although our service is free, you are using your own server. As a result, you will incur expenses equal to the set tariff at the chosen cloud provider. There are no further payments made beyond that."
        },
        "5": {
          "question": "Where to buy a server in order to start using the personal VPN?",
          "answer": "We did a thorough search among all server providers, finding the one that satisfies our quality requirements. Vultr met them all:<ol><li>Having hourly payments as you go, instead of monthly payments</li><li>No setup fees</li><li>Friendly and comfortable interface</li><li>Low costs</li><li>A lot of available locations for servers</li><li>Automated nearly instant server creation and destruction</li>"
        },
        "6": {
          "question": "Can I reuse a server that has a lot of installed programs already?",
          "answer": "No, it is not recommended even if it is possible. We recommend using a freshly installed operational system to avoid any conflicts with already existing programs. As an exception, in 99 cases out of 100, it is possible to reuse the server, which was used to install ShapeVPN before. A newer installation will just override the old one."
        },
        "7": {
          "question": "What are the used encrypting protocols?",
          "answer": "Wireguard is made out of the following components:<ol><li>ChaCha20 for symmetric encryption</li><li>authenticated with Poly1305, using RFC7539's AEAD construction</li><li>Curve25519 for ECDH</li><li>BLAKE2s for hashing and keyed hashing, described in RFC7693</li><li>SipHash24 for hashtable keys</li><li>HKDF for key derivation, as described in RFC5869</li><li>UDP — as a transport protocol</li></ol>"
        },
        "8": {
          "question": "What ensures security?",
          "answer": "We ensured security from external and internal threats. Our file systems are locked into a read-only state. The service uses temporally generated unique keys to encrypt and decrypt the data through its usage for each installation. Any installing data is automatically erased when the service job is completed."
